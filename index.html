                <p>Different types of data structures are used for varying kinds of data - for instance, word documents will have a different data structure than spreadsheets. Data structures act as the fundamental foundations of all computer software processes.

                <p> Data structures can seem harrowing at first but devote enough time, and youâ€™ll find them easy as pie. They are a vital part of programming, and almost every project will require you to use them. Knowing what data structure is ideal for

                <p>Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing
                    these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!).
                </p>
                <p> Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques,
                    just like the real banks do.

                <p> If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever:
                </p>
                <p> A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it.

                <p> The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize.
                </p>
                <p>Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace.
                </p>
                <p> The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right?
                </p>
                <p>Well, we're going to find out! The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016. Let's load it in and take a look.
